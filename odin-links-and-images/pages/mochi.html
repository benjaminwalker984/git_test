        <h1>JPG Mochi</h1>
        <p>JPG images are great for keeping file size small, even with a variety of colors.</p>
        <p>JPG images dont allow for transparent pixels, which is why you can see white edges on the images sometimes</p>

        <h1>Gif Mochi</h1>
        <p>Gif images have a limited color palette, which makes them bad for photos</p>
        <p>What they lack in detail they make up for in being able to have simple animations</p>

        <h1>PNG Mochi</h1>
        <p>PNG's are great for a high level of detail. Think photos, logos, and Icons</p>
        <p>Because of the high level of detail, they have larger file sizes than their JPG counterparts</p>

        <h1>SVG Mochi</h1>
        <p>SVG images are different from the ones above due to their scalable quality</p>
        <p>Because they arent pixel based, they have many applications where quality is a concern.</p>
        <p>One potential issue with PNG's is for them to display consistently across browsers, one must convert any text fields to outlines using your image editor</p>
